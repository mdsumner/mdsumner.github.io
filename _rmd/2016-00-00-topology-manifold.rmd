# Topology from a Manifold perspective

* Areas, Lines and Points have just 2-value coordinates, X/Y or Longitude/Latitude
* Lines and Areas are composed of linear strings, like simple features
* Space-filling, i.e. inside vs. out for Areas is done using the even-odd rule
* Pathologies in topology a la simple features are dealt with on the fly by background constrained Delaunay Triangulation, and re-composition to linear strings by tracing cycles in the mesh
* Explicit pathology fixing is available via Normalize Topology and Normalize Metric
